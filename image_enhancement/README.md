# Using Laplacian Pyramid for Image Enhancement

This is a simple implementation of image enhancement using Laplacian Pyramid. The code is written in MATLAB and can be found in the `main.m` file. The script reads an image from the `images` folder, enhances the image using Laplacian Pyramid, and displays the original and enhanced images side by side.
