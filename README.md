Some basic image processing algorithms and implementations that I developed during school projects or in my spare time. The algorithms are implemented in MATLAB. The repository contains the following algorithms:

*  Histogram Equalization
*  Laplacian Pyramid for Image Enhancement
*  K-means Clustering for Quantization and Segmentation
