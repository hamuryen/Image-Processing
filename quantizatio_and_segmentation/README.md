# K-means Clustering for Quantization and Segmentation

This repository contains the k-means clustering algorithm implemented in MATLAB for image quantization and segmentation. K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm is implemented in the `quantize.m` and `quantize.m` files, and an example of image quantization and segmentation is provided in the `main.m` file. The script reads an image from the `images` folder, applies k-means clustering for quantization and segmentation, and displays the original and segmented images side by side. The number of clusters (k) can be adjusted to control the quantization and segmentation results.
